# \[TTT2/Sandbox\] Voice Chat Toggle

Adds a key binding & console command to _toggle_ voice chat on and off so that players no longer have to use push-to-talk.
Compatible with proximity voice chat addons.

Players can change the keybinding in the TTT2 F1 settings menu (default binding is `H`).
The console command to do the same is `voice_toggle`.

## Admin Settings

Admins can open the TTT2 F1 menu > Server Addons > Voice Chat Toggle to change the following settings:

| ConVar                   | Default | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| voice_toggle_auto_enable |       0 | Automatically enable voice chat for players when they join.                 |

## Sandbox

If you're using this in sandbox you'll have too manually bind a key to the `voice_toggle` console command.
