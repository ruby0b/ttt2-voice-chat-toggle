# \[TTT2\] Voice Chat Toggle

Adds a key binding & console command to _toggle_ voice chat on and off so that players no longer have to use push-to-talk.
Compatible with proximity voice chat addons.

Players can change the keybinding in the TTT2 F1 settings menu (default binding is `H`).
The console command to do the same is `voice_toggle`.
